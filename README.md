# A-Network-for-Monitoring-and-Assessing-Water-Quality-for-Drinking-and-Irrigation-Purposes
This project aims to develop an intelligent and real-time monitoring system, Water Net, that assesses water quality for both drinking and irrigation. It leverages sensor networks, machine learning algorithms, and web technologies to analyze key water quality parameters and provide insights for proactive management.
Project Description:
"Water Net" is an intelligent system designed to monitor and assess the quality of water used for both drinking and irrigation. It integrates real-time sensor networks, machine learning models, and cloud-based data analytics to detect water quality parameters such as pH, turbidity, hardness, chloramines, and more. These sensors are strategically placed to track contaminants like heavy metals and pesticides in various water sources.

The system uses Python and machine learning libraries (like scikit-learn, pandas, and NLTK) along with the Django framework for web development. A MySQL database is managed through XAMPP, and the UI allows users to log in, register, and view water quality predictions.

Key features:

Differentiates between water suitable for drinking vs irrigation.

Uses models like Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Tree for classification.

Offers prediction accuracy through a voting classifier.

Visual representation via graphs and charts.

Designed with scalability and sustainability in mind.
